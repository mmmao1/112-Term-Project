"Piracy: The Game"

This is a top-down shooter that has the player control a little ship
and traverse the map in search of enemies to kill. Enemies drop gold, and 
as the player gets more gold, they get upgrades and the enemies get tougher

If downloaded correctly, there should be three .py files and one .txt file. 
Just open up them all, and run "main.py" and that should start the game

I'm using the default python library and Tkinter, so don't have to download anything. 

If you want to see a smaller map being generated, go into actual.py and look for "data.maxIslands" and change that value to something under 300
